Turning Niryo One into a 3D printer

The concept of this programm is to allow the Niryo One 6 axis arm to be able to 3D print. It is used as a portable programm, not a module.
Most of 3D printers are doing a 2D+ print by elevating a XY print, the real 3D allows to print on curved shapes:

Niryo is able to print in 2D+ :

But due to the robot limitations the quality is far from a good printer, despite this weakness the Niryo is able to do real 3D prints like this example :
